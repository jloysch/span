Introducing SPAN: My First Encryption Algorithm - Joshua Loysch

SPAN is a cool little encryption algorithm that takes a bit of a different approach to encrypting data. 

You can enter a plaintext phrase such as hello and receive a cipher. Working exapmle:

> 'hello'

In this system, 'hello' can be expressed as '143.1871A78.62515A263.7692A140.9315A3.4798527A115.6556A40.83441A266.25964A134.09538A310.7332A' with the decoder being 59.62687degsR\\0.888\\8

THERE ARE *MULTIPLE* ways to represent the same expression as well.

THERE ARE *BOTH* Reversible and Irreversible ciphers this algorithm can generate.
