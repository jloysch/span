Introducing SPAN: My First Encryption Algorithm - Joshua Loysch

SPAN is a cool little encryption algorithm that takes a bit of a different approach to encrypting data. 

You can enter a plaintext phrase such as hello and receive a cipher. Working exapmle:

> 'hello'

In this system, 'hello' can be expressed as '143.1871A78.62515A263.7692A140.9315A3.4798527A115.6556A40.83441A266.25964A134.09538A310.7332A' with the decoder being 59.62687degsR\\0.888\\8

THERE ARE *MULTIPLE* ways to represent the same expression as well.

THERE ARE *BOTH* Reversible and Irreversible ciphers this algorithm can generate.

This is the first working version, a little idea I have had for a while that I wanted to get coded up. I am excited to see how this goes :)

Theoretically this could have a complexity of 2^129 + 3.194e38 so it's surprisingly secure for such a simple approach.
